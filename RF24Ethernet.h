 /**
 * @mainpage RF24Ethernet library: TCP/IP over RF24Network
 *
 * @section Overview Overview
 *
 * The RF24Ethernet library was initially designed as an experiment and potential testing tool for RF24Network, allowing a Raspberry Pi to
 * act as a TCP/IP gateway or host for connected sensor nodes. An Arduino can interface with any Linux machine or SLIP capable device supporting USB, or
 * preferably, an RPi runs companion software, RF24toTUN, which creates a network interface linked to the RF24 radio network. This interface can be
 * further linked to the local network or internet. This allows the RPi or Arduino gateway to perform automatic discovery and routing of TCP/IP data,
 * with no required pre-configuration or interaction from the user beyond assigning appropriate addresses to the nodes initially.
 *
 * @section What What does it do?
 *
 * RF24Ethernet creates a network of internet enabled RF24/Arduino sensors. It provides an API and interface very similar to the Arduino Ethernet library,
 * to allow sensor nodes to connect out to local or internet based devices to retrieve or send information, or be connected to from the internet or your
 * local network directly.  
 * 
 * Sensor nodes can act as individual web servers, simple command-and-control servers, or can connect out as required via TCP/IP. 
 * 
 *
 * @section How How does it work?
 *
 * RF24Ethernet utilizes the UIP TCP/IP stack, allowing Arduino devices to use a Raspberry Pi running RF24toTUN or Arduino
 * as a gateway to your network or the internet, or simply as a repository for sensor information. The RF24, RF24Network and optionally RF24Mesh libraries
 * handle the underlying routing, addressing etc. so users do not need to be familiar with the radio modules or libraries.  
 *  
 * RF24Network addresses need to be assigned as MAC addresses, and IP addresses can be configured as desired by the user. The master node (00) uses
 * either the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) or RF24Mesh to find the appropriate nodes when IP traffic is sent though, and routes traffic to the correct
 * RF24Network address.
 * 
 * This provides a fairly seamless interaction, since users only need to configure standard IP forwarding and firewall rules as desired.
 *
 * @section News Update News
 * 
 * \version  <b>1.22b - Jan 16 2015</b>
 *  - Add UDP support
 *  - Add DNS support
 *  - Add support for up to 512 byte buffer size
 *  - Reduce used memory and program space
 *  - Support for multiple connections with per-connection memory  buffers
 *
 * \version  <b>1.1b - Jan 4 2015</b>

 *  - Better TCP window management to prevent hangs during client downloads
 *  - Stability improvements
 *
 * \version  <b>1.0b - Dec 2014</b>
 *  - Outgoing client data corruption should be fixed
 *
 * @section Config Configuration and Setup
 * 
 * RF24Ethernet requires the RF24 and RF24Network_DEV libraries (optionally RF24Mesh) found on my github repository at https://github.com/TMRh20  <br>
 *  <br>
 *  <b> RPi </b>
 * On the Raspberry Pi, a companion program, RF24toTUN must be installed along with the RF24 and RF24Network libraries
 * @note RF24toTUN requires the boost libraries. Run @code sudo apt-get install libboost1.50-all @endcode
 * 
 * See the video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBAIqAaRu0g for a walk-through of the setup with Raspberry Pi and Arduino.
 *
 * 1. @code wget http://tmrh20.github.io/RF24Installer/RPi/install.sh  @endcode  
 * 2. @code chmod +x install.sh  @endcode  
 * 3. @code ./install.sh  @endcode  
 * 4. Edit the included rf24totun_configAndPing.sh to modify the IP information to suit your desired network config  
 * 5. @code sudo ./rf24totun_configAndPing.sh 2 3 @endcode  
 * 6. The '2' specifies the last octet of the RPi IP address. The '3' specifies the last octet of the node it will attempt to ping once started.  
 * 7. Raspberry Pi defaults to the master node (00). Secondary Raspberry pi nodes would need the MAC address modified accordingly.
 *   
 *<b> Arduino </b>
 * 1. For Arduino devices, the RF24, RF24Network and RF24Ethernet libraries need to be installed.
 * 2. Open the included Getting_Started_SimpleServer or Getting_Started_SimpleClient example
 * 3. Configure the RF24Network address (see http://tmrh20.github.io/RF24Network_Dev/ for more info)
 * 4. Configure the IP address according to your preferences, with the gateway set to the chosen IP of the RPi.
 * 5. Connect into your nodes web-server at http://ip-of-your-node:1000 from the RPi or configure the client sketch to connect to a server
 * running on the Raspberry Pi.
 * Note: To minimize memory usage on Arduino, edit RF24Network_config.h with a text editor, and uncomment #define DISABLE_USER_PAYLOADS. This
 * will disable standard RF24Network messages, and only allow external data, such as TCP/IP information. 
 *
 * <b> Non-Raspberry Pi (Linux etc) Devices </b><br>
 * Arduino can also function as a gateway for any Linux machine or PC/MAC that supports SLIP. <br>
 * See the SLIP_Gateway and SLIP_InteractiveServer
 * examples for usage without the need for a Raspberry Pi.
 * 
 * <b>Accessing External Systems: Forwarding and Routing</b>
 *
 * In order to give your network or nodes access to your network or the internet beyond the RPi, it needs to be configured to route traffic
 * between the networks.
 * 1. Run @code sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 @endcode to allow the RPi to forward requests between the network interfaces
 * 2. @code sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE @endcode to allow the RPi to perform NAT between the network interfaces <br>
 * @warning <b>Note:</b> Users are responsible to manage further routing rules along with their IP traffic in order to prevent unauthorized access. 
 * Users may also need to add a static route or port forwarding to their PC or router to connect in to or ping the sensor nodes.
 * @section Advanced Advanced Configuration and Info
 *
 * See the <a href="group__UipConfiguration.html">User Configuration</a> section for modifying uip-conf.h
 *
 * @section Limitations Limitations
 *
 * The library is currently limited to TCP communications only, with statically assigned IP addresses. UDP frames can be up to 512 bytes in length, so additional
 * functionality (DHCP/DNS) is limited by available memory. At this time, there are no immediate plans to develop UDP functionality.
 *
 * @section MAC_Addys MAC address formatting:
 * RF24Ethernet uses a simple method of formatting the MAC addresses, using the first two bytes to store the RF24Network address, and the remaining
 * four bytes to store the characters 'RF24', which makes identification of nodes via MAC address very simple using standard monitoring tools.
 *
 * | RF24Network Address| Byte 0 | Byte 1 | Byte 2 | Byte 3 | Byte 4 | Byte 5 |
 * |--------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
 * |      n/a           |   R    |   F    |   2    |   4    |Octal LB|Octal HB|
 * |      01            |  0x52  |  0x46  |  0x32  |   0x34 |  0x01  |  0x00  |
 * |      011           |  0x52  |  0x46  |  0x32  |   0x34 |  0x09  |  0x00  |
 * |      0443          |  0x52  |  0x46  |  0x32  |   0x34 |  0x23  |  0x01  |
 *
