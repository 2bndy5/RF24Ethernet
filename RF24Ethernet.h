 /**
 * @mainpage RF24Ethernet library: TCP/IP over RF24Network
 *
 * @section Overview Overview
 *
 * The RF24Ethernet library was initially designed as an experiment and potential testing tool for RF24Network, allowing a Raspberry Pi to
 * act as a TCP/IP gateway or host for connected sensor nodes. The RPi runs companion software, RF24toTUN, which creates a network interface linked
 * to the RF24 radio network, which can be further linked to the local network or internet. This allows the RPi to perform automatic discovery and
 * routing of TCP/IP data, with no required pre-configuration or interaction from the user beyond assigning appropriate addresses to the nodes
 * initially.
 *
 * @section What What does it do?
 *
 * RF24Ethernet provides an API and interface very similar to the Arduino Ethernet library, to allow sensor nodes to connect out to local or
 * internet based devices to retrieve or send information, or be connected to from the internet or your local network directly. Sensor nodes
 * can act as individual web servers, simple command-and-control servers, or can connect out as required via TCP/IP. 
 * 
 *
 * @section How How does it work?
 *
 * RF24Ethernet utilizes the UIP TCP/IP stack to provide communication, allowing Arduino devices to use a Raspberry Pi running RF24toTUN as
 * a gateway to your network or the internet, or simply as a repository for sensor information. RF24Network addresses need to be assigned
 * in the usual manner, and IP addresses can be configured as desired by the user. The master node (00) uses the Address Resolution
 * Protocol (ARP) to find the appropriate nodes when IP traffic is forwarded though, and routes traffic to the correct RF24Network address.
 * This provides a fairly seamless interaction, since users only need to configure standard IP forwarding and firewall rules as desired.
 *
 * @section Config Configuration and Setup
 * 
 * RF24Ethernet requires the RF24 and RF24Network_DEV libraries found on my github repository at https://github.com/TMRh20  <br>
 *  <br>
 *  <b> RPi </b>
 * 1. On the Raspberry Pi, a companion program, RF24toTUN must be installed along with the RF24 and RF24Network libraries
 * 2. Edit the included rf24totun_configAndPing.sh to modify the IP information to suit your desired network config
 * 3. Run @code sudo ./rf24totun_configAndPing.sh 2 3 @endcode
 * 4. The '2' specifies the last octet of the RPi IP address. The '3' specifies the last octet of the node it will attempt to ping once started.
 * 5. Raspberry Pi defaults to the master node (00). Secondary Raspberry pi nodes would need the MAC address modified accordingly. * 
 *   
 *<b> Arduino </b>
 * 1. For Arduino devices, the RF24, RF24Network and RF24Ethernet libraries need to be installed.
 * 2. Open the included Getting_Started_SimpleServer or Getting_Started_SimpleClient example
 * 3. Configure the RF24Network address (see http://tmrh20.github.io/RF24Network_Dev/ for more info)
 * 4. Configure the IP address according to your preferences, with the gateway set to the chosen IP of the RPi.
 * 5. Connect into your nodes web-server at http://ip-of-your-node:1000 from the RPi or configure the client sketch to connect to a server
 * running on the Raspberry Pi.
 * Note: To minimize memory usage on Arduino, edit RF24Network_config.h with a text editor, and uncomment #define DISABLE_USER_PAYLOADS. This
 * will disable standard RF24Network messages, and only allow external data, such as TCP/IP information. 
 *
 * <b>Accessing External Systems: Forwarding and Routing</b>
 *
 * In order to give your network or nodes access to your network or the internet beyond the RPi, it needs to be configured to route traffic
 * between the networks.
 * 1. Run @code sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 @endcode to allow the RPi to forward requests between the network interfaces
 * 2. @code sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE @endcode to allow the RPi to perform NAT between the network interfaces <br>
 * <b>Note:</b> Users are responsible to manage further routing rules along with their IP traffic in order to prevent unauthorized access. 
 * Users may also need to add a static route to their PC or router to connect in to or ping the sensor nodes.
 * @section Advanced Advanced Configuration and Info
 *
 * Additional settings are available by editing the uip-conf.h file included with the library. The main option available is the 
 * #define UIP_CONF_BUFFER_SIZE setting, which will define the maximum available size of TCP payloads. The default is 120 bytes, but
 * large values can speed up data transfers, since more data can be included in every payload. Very large values are untested.
 * When modifying the UIP_CONF_BUFFER_SIZE setting, the #define MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE must also be adjusted in the RF24Network_config.h file, to
 * allow the network to pass the same size of payloads as RF24Ethernet accepts.
 * RF24Ethernet provides an interface for TCP/IP, but does not really understand the concept of sockets, ports, etc. so all data received
 * goes into the same incoming buffer currently. This behaviour may be modified in the future.
 *
 * @section Limitations Limitations
 *
 * The library is currently limited to TCP communications only, with statically assigned IP addresses. UDP frames can be up to 512 bytes in length, so additional
 * functionality (DHCP/DNS) is limited by available memory. At this time, there are no immediate plans to develop UDP functionality.
 *
 * @section MAC_Addys MAC address formatting:
 * RF24Ethernet uses a simple method of formatting the MAC addresses, using the first two bytes to store the RF24Network address, and the remaining
 * four bytes to store the characters 'RF24', which makes identification of nodes via MAC address very simple using standard monitoring tools.
 *
 * | RF24Network Address| Byte 0 | Byte 1 | Byte 2 | Byte 3 | Byte 4 | Byte 5 |
 * |--------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
 * |      n/a           |Octal LB|Octal HB|   R    |   F    |   2    |   4    |
 * |      01            | 0x01   |  0x00  |  0x52  |  0x46  |  0x32  |   0x34 |
 * |      011           | 0x09   |  0x00  |  0x52  |  0x46  |  0x32  |   0x34 |
 * |      0443          | 0x23   |  0x01  |  0x52  |  0x46  |  0x32  |   0x34 |
 *
